NAME
    Tie::InsertOrderHash - insert-order-preserving tied hash

SYNOPSIS
      tie my %hash => 'Tie::InsertOrderHash',
        one_two => 'buckle my shoe',
        3_4 => 'shut the door',
        V_VI => 'pick up sticks';
      %hash{7_of_9} => 'not bad';

      print "@{[keys %hash]}\n"; # prints keys in order inserted

DESCRIPTION
    Tie::InsertOrderHash is a tied hash which preserves the order of
    inserted keys. Regular perl hashes regurgitate keys in an unspecified
    order, but at times one wishes to have the properties of both a hash and
    an array.

    As an extention, one may list *key*/*value* pairs as additional
    arguments to "tie", as in the example above.

  EXPORT
    None.
